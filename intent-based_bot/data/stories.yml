# This file contains all stories that the bot follows.
# The stories are grouped into websupport stories that correspond to a certain websupport intent and
# stories that correspond to more generall intents (non-websupport intents). Each group is sorted alphabetically by name.
# For the most part these stores follow the same structure (see first story description).
# In some cases, a suggestion of a follow-up intent is triggered (see delete infobox or site_delete)


stories:
- story: break
  steps:
  - intent: break # This story is triggered if bot detects intent 'break'.
  - action: utter_break # Chatbot utters response of intent 'break' as defined in the domain.yml file.
  - action: action_question_answered # Custom action, that asks if user wants to create ticket.

# The path followed after choosing 'yes' is handled by the rule
# 'create ticket if bot can't answer question' (see rules.yml).
# Otherwise bot continues answering next question.
